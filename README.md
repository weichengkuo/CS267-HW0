## Bio
I am a second-year PhD student (Class 2015) working with Prof. Jitendra Malik in the Vision group at University of California Berkeley. I graduated from National Taiwan University summa cum laude (top 1% in class). In addition, I was the Berkeley Graduate Fellowship recipient of EECS department. My current interests are Computer Vision and Machine learning, but I also have some journal publications in biomedical imaging and medical image analysis. In 2012, I worked as a summer business analyst at Mckinsey&Company. In summer 2015, I interned with Prof. William T Freeman and Ce Liu at Google Research. In summer 2016, I worked as a research intern at Apple to develop video analysis algorithm by unsupervised sequence learning techniques. Through this CS267 class, I'm hoping to learn more about how parallel computing can be applied to solve large-scale video analysis problem -- this includes the common paradigms of parallel algorithms and the hardware platforms for high performance.  

## Application: Large-Scale Video Analysis
In computer vision, video is always a challenging but interesting problem, because it has much more information than still images. For example, motion cues tell us a lot about the activities in the video that still images do not reveal. The challenge here is videos are much larger than still images. Take a 30 fps video for example. A one-minute recording then contains 1800 frames! Think about how many videos Youtube or Facebook process each day. In addition, robotics community are collecting all kinds of videos right now based on their sensory inputs. Scientists are collecting all sorts of time lapse data as well. The world is surely moving toward collecting more videos! Unfortunately, a naive way to run object detection on the aforementioned one-minute video would take about 1800s ~ 0.5 hour, but if we take advantage of parallel computing, we could be done in 1s! Due to the high parallelizability of video, I believe parallel computing will play increasingly important role in video processing down the road. 

Since most computer vision algorithms rely on deep learning nowadays, video analysis is no exception. Here's some background about deep learning.
